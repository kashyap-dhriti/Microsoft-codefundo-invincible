The formulation of a solution to help cities better predict and prepare for natural disasters is definitely a complex webbed task consisting of many interdependent and mandatory components. The proposal of a solution for the problem for the same will be on the same lines. We have a segmented structure for our project which has many components required to improve the safety and prediction of natural disasters to prevent heavy death toll. Our fudamental aims for the project are :

Prediction Section :

1. Weather classification based on deep convolutional neural networks.
   a. Dataset stored continually on the database
   b. Model trained and updated on a periodic basis
   c. Constant updation gives a better prediciton accuracy and rate.
   d. Prediction updates given as alerts if the status of any weather event worsens.
   e. A cross check system to check for predictions of severe weather along with current evacuation and weather updates
2. Classification of weather based on pleasant , harsh , severe , alert sections.
3. Alert trigger automatically for highly severe weather conditions.
4. band 50, 40 messages recognition used by india and usa for alert messages.

Management Section :

1. Interlinking of different NGO's onto the same platform which can be either a mobile device or a personal computer.
2. Interlinking and registration of voulenteer teams and prioritizing work among them in times of need.
3. Donation teams and sponsorship teams registration, instruction of where to send supplies based on need.
4. Constant news and third-party services extensions for provision of information exchange. (Ex. news, google , Update-services ,        broadcast etc.) 

Update Section :

1. Victims, and families can update 
   a. Requirements
   b. Location
   c. Needs and current status
2. Providers and sponsors can 
   a. update what materials have been dispatched and to where 
   b. Means of material transportation with emergency status

Emergency Services :

1. Constant updation of contacts of nearby support teams and services
2. Gps location of victims and alert trigger for requirement of immediate attention
3. Nearest evacuation group and safe area.
4. Nearest mode of transport by voulenteers.
5. Automatic SOS signal (either light or ringer or both )trigger by either the voulenteer or the victim for identification.


All of this will be processed and stored on the virtual machine mounted on the server by Microsoft Azure. The network will be trained and updated constantly while gaining worthwhile information and simultaneously discarding repetetive information.
